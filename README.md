# google-homepage
Odin Project to recreate the google homepage.

The goal of this project is to recreate the looks of the google homepage. It doesn't need to be functional, or actually let you search anything. The idea is to just get practice with being able to style and recreate a page that I found on the internet. This will also be practice with using my browser's inspection devtools.

"Finished" with this project as of right now because I feel like I've gotten it to a point where I'm happy with it. At some point I might revisit once I know more and I'm more comfortable with web dev. I would like to add media queries to this project at some point to give it some responsiveness. But for now I'm happy with how this has turned out and I'm looking forward to what's in store in the rest of the Odin Project.
