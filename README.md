# google-homepage
Odin Project to recreate the google homepage.

The goal of this project is to recreate the looks of the google homepage. It doesn't need to be functional, or actually let you search anything. The idea is to just get practice with being able to style and recreate a page that I found on the internet. This will also be practice with using my browser's inspection devtools.
